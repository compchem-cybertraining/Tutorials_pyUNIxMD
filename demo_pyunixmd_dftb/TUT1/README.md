## After submitting the task,enter code here `sbatch submit.sh`. You will see this generating SCRADIR.
### SCRADIR is used to store computational data during calculations using pyUNIXMD.
 - If the computation process is not finished, the run-out output file is saved in SCRADIR.
 - If the computation process is finished, the run-out output file will be under the same path as SCRADIR.
   Also, there will be a backup of the output file in SCRADIR.

 - The reference file output of Folder ï¼š01-dftb-BOMD-C60 
 is too large, so it is compressed.
 - More fullerene structures are available on this site [this link](https://nanotube.msu.edu/fullerene/fullerene-isomers.html).
